Use a web browser to access the router When you connect to the network (either with WiFi or with an Ethernet cable), you can use a web browser to access the router to view or change its settings. The first time you access the router, the NETGEAR installation assistant automatically checks to see if your router can connect to your Internet service. Use the automatic Internet setup option You can set up your router automatically, or you can use a web browser to access the router and set up your router manually. Before you start the setup process, get your ISP information and make sure that the computers and devices in the network use the settings described here. When your Internet service starts, your Internet service provider (ISP) typically gives you all the information needed to connect to the Internet. For DSL service, you might need the following information to set up your router: The ISP configuration information for your DSL account ISP login name and password Fixed or static IP address settings (special deployment by ISP; this setting is rare) If you cannot locate this information, ask your ISP to provide it. When your Internet connection is working, you no longer need to launch the ISP login program on your computer to access the Internet. When you start an Internet application, your router automatically logs you in. Installation and basic setup takes about 15 minutes to complete. To automatically set up your router: 1. Power on your router. 2. Make sure that your WiFi-enabled computer or mobile device is connected to the router with an Ethernet cable (wired) or wirelessly with the preset WiFi security settings listed on the label. Note: If you want to change the routers WiFi settings, use a wired connection to avoid being disconnected when the new WiFi settings take effect.

Set up an IPv6 6rd tunnel Internet connection The 6rd protocol makes it possible to deploy IPv6 to sites using a service providers IPv4 network. 6rd uses the service providers own IPv6 address prefix. This limits the operational domain of 6rd to the service providers network and is under direct control of the service provider. The IPv6 service provided is equivalent to native IPv6. The 6rd mechanism relies on an algorithmic mapping between the IPv6 and IPv4 addresses that are assigned for use within the service providers network. This mapping allows for automatic determination of IPv4 tunnel endpoints from IPv6 prefixes, allowing stateless operation of 6rd.

Your settings are saved. Change the MTU size The maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the largest data packet a network device transmits. When one network device communicates across the Internet with another, the data packets travel through many devices along the way. If a device in the data path uses a lower MTU setting than the other devices, the data packets must be split or fragmented to accommodate the device with the smallest MTU. The best MTU setting for NETGEAR equipment is often the default value. In some situations, changing the value fixes one problem but causes another. Leave the MTU unchanged unless one of these situations occurs: You experience problems connecting to your ISP or other Internet service, and the technical support of either the ISP or NETGEAR recommends changing the MTU setting. For example, if a secure website does not open, or displays only part of a web page, you might need to change the MTU. You use VPN and experience severe performance problems. You used a program to optimize MTU for performance reasons, and now you are experiencing connectivity or performance problems. Note: An incorrect MTU setting can cause Internet communication problems. For example, you might not be able to access certain websites, frames within websites, secure login pages, or FTP or POP servers. To change the MTU size: 1. Launch a web browser from a computer or mobile device that is connected to your Orbi network. 2. Enter orbilogin.com. A login window opens. 3. Enter the admin user name and password. The user name is admin. The password is the one that you specified the first time that you logged in. The user name and password are case-sensitive. The BASIC Home page displays. 4.

5. In the MTU Size field, enter a value from 64 to 1500. 6. Click the Apply button. Your settings are saved. If you suspect an MTU problem, a common solution is to change the MTU to 1400. If you are willing to experiment, you can gradually reduce the MTU from the maximum value of 1500 until the problem goes away. The following table describes common MTU sizes and applications. Table 5. Common MTU sizes Application MTU The largest Ethernet packet size. This setting is typical for connections that do not use PPPoE or VPN, and is the default value for NETGEAR routers, adapters, and switches. 1500 Used in PPPoE environments. 1492 Maximum size to use for pinging.

5 Specify WiFi Settings This chapter includes the following sections: About the WiFi networks Manage the settings for the main WiFi network Manage the IoT WiFi settings Set up a guest WiFi network Change your region Enable or disable 20/40 MHz coexistence for the 2.4 GHz radio Change the preamble mode for a radio Change the radio transmission power control 52

About the WiFi networks The router provides three WiFi networks: Main network: The main WiFi network of the router broadcasts simultaneously in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio bands. The router supports automatic bandsteering between these two radio bands in the main WiFi network. The main network is enabled by default. You cannot disable the main network, or broadcast of the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio bands in the main network. You can change the WiFi network name (SSID), security option, and password for the main network, all of which are unique to the main network. However, if you change the following settings for the main network, the changes apply to all WiFi networks on the router: - AX feature: By default, the AX feature is always enabled for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio bands. You can disable the AX feature for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio bands individually. - Channels: You can set fixed channels for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio bands individually. IoT network: The Internet of things (IoT) network is enabled by default so that you can connect WiFi-enabled smart devices that can range from light bulbs to appliances. If you do not need the IoT network, you can disable it. You can select the radio bands for the IoT network and change the WiFi network name (SSID), security option, and password, all of which are unique to the IoT network. Guest network: The optional guest network is disabled by default, but you can enable it so that guests and visitors can connect to your WiFi without compromising the security of your other WiFi networks. You can change the WiFi network name (SSID), security option, and password for the guest network, all of which are unique to the guest network. Manage the settings for the main WiFi network The router and satellite come preset with the same WiFi network name (SSID) and the same WiFi security. You can find the SSID and password on the router label and on the satellite label. If you log in to the router and change the WiFi settings, the router automatically sends the new settings to the satellite. If you change your WiFi settings, make a note of the new settings and store it in a safe place where you can easily find it.

If your computer or mobile device is using a WiFi connection when you change the network name (SSID) or other WiFi security settings, you are disconnected when you click the Apply button. To avoid this problem, use a computer with a wired connection to access the router. Enable or disable the AX feature for the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz radio band The AX feature improves your networks WiFi capacity, Internet upload and download speeds, and WiFi range by allowing WiFi traffic from different devices to be concurrently managed. To do this, the AX feature uses Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple-Access (OFDMA), 4x4 multi-user MIMO, and intelligent scheduling. The AX feature is enabled by default for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio bands. You cannot disable WiFi broadcast for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio bands, but you can disable the AX feature for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio bands. Note: If you change the AX feature for the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz radio band, the change also applies to the IoT network and the guest network. To enable or disable the AX feature for the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz radio band: 1. Launch a web browser from a computer or mobile device that is connected to your Orbi network. 2. Enter orbilogin.net. A login window opens. 3. Enter the admin user name and password. The user name is admin. The password is the one that you specified the first time that you logged in. The user name and password are case-sensitive. The BASIC Home page displays. 4. Select Wireless. The Wireless Setup page displays. 5. In the Enable AX section, select or clear the following check boxes: Enable 2.4 GHz: Selecting the check box enables the AX feature for the 2.4 GHz radio band. Clearing this check box disables the AX feature for the 2.4 GHz radio band. Enable 5 GHz: Selecting the check box enables the AX feature for the 5 GHz radio band. Clearing this check box disables the AX feature for the 5 GHz radio band. User Manual 54 Specify WiFi Settings Orbi Whole Home Tri-Band Mesh WiFi 6 System

Change the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz WiFi channel You can change the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz WiFi channel. In some regions, not all channels are available. Do not change the channel unless you experience interference (shown by lost connections or slow data transfers). If this happens, experiment with different channels to see which is the best. When you use multiple access points, it is better if adjacent access points use different channels to reduce interference. The recommended channel spacing between adjacent access points is four channels (for example, for the 2.4 GHz radio band, use Channels 1 and 5, or 6 and 10).

Most ISPs use dynamically assigned IP addresses. This means that the IP address can change at any time. You can use the IP address to access your network remotely, but most people dont know what their IP addresses are or when this number changes. To make it easier to connect, you can get a free account with a Dynamic DNS service that lets you use a domain name to access your home network. To use this account, you must set up the router to use Dynamic DNS. Then the router notifies the Dynamic DNS service provider whenever its IP address changes. When you access your Dynamic DNS account, the service finds the current IP address of your home network and automatically connects you. If your ISP assigns a private WAN IP address (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x), the Dynamic DNS service does not work because private addresses are not routed on the Internet.

Set up a default DMZ server The default DMZ server feature is helpful when you are using some online games and videoconferencing applications that are incompatible with Network Address Translation (NAT). The router is programmed to recognize some of these applications and to work correctly with them, but other applications might not function well. In some cases, one local computer can run the application correctly if the IP address for that computer is entered as the default DMZ server. DMZ servers pose a security risk. A computer designated as the default DMZ server loses much of the protection of the firewall and is exposed to exploits from the Internet. If compromised, the DMZ server computer can be used to attack other computers on your network. The router usually detects and discards incoming traffic from the Internet that is not a response to one of your local computers or a service that you configured in the Port Forwarding/Port Triggering page. Instead of discarding this traffic, you can specify that the router forwards the traffic to one computer on your network. This computer is called the default DMZ server. To set up a default DMZ server: 1. Launch a web browser from a computer or mobile device that is connected to your Orbi network. 2. Enter orbilogin.com. A login window opens. 3. Enter the admin user name and password. The user name is admin. The password is the one that you specified the first time that you logged in. The user name and password are case-sensitive.

5. Select the radio button next to the reserved address. 6. Click the Delete button. The address is removed. Manage custom static routes Typically, you do not need to add static routes unless you use multiple routers or multiple IP subnets on your network. As an example of when a static route is needed, consider the following case: Your main Internet access is through a cable modem to an ISP. Your home network includes an ISDN router for connecting to the company where you are employed. This routers address on your LAN is 192.168.1.100. Your companys network address is 134.177.0.0. When you set up your router, two implicit static routes were created. A default route was created with your ISP as the gateway, and a second static route was created to your local network for all 192.168.1.x addresses. With this configuration, if you try to access a device on the 134.177.0.0 network, your router forwards your request to the ISP. The ISP forwards your request to the company where you are employed, and the company firewall is likely to deny the request. In this case you must define a static route, telling your router to access 134.177.0.0 through the ISDN router at 192.168.1.100. Here is an example: The Destination IP Address and IP Subnet Mask fields specify that this static route applies to all 134.177.x.x addresses. The Gateway IP Address field specifies that all traffic for these addresses will be forwarded to the ISDN router at 192.168.1.100. The Private check box is selected only as a precautionary security measure in case RIP is activated. Set up a static route To set up a static route: 1. Launch a web browser from a computer or mobile device that is connected to your Orbi network. 2. Enter orbilogin.com. A login window opens.

### Content
Use the router as a WiFi access point only By default, the Orbi router functions as both a router and WiFi access point. You can set up the router to run as a WiFi access point only on the same local network as another router or gateway. For example, you can use the Orbi router as a WiFi access point that connects to a gateway or modem router that you already use for your Internet service. In this situation, you do not need to change the settings for the gateway or modem router. To set up the Orbi router as an AP after you set up your Internet connection: 1. Use an Ethernet cable to connect the Internet port of the Orbi router to a LAN port on your existing gateway or modem router. 2. Launch a web browser from a computer or mobile device that is connected to your Orbi network. 3. Enter orbilogin.com. A login window opens. 4. Enter the admin user name and password. The user name is admin. The password is the one that you specified the first time that you logged in. The user name and password are case-sensitive. The BASIC Home page displays. 5. Select ADVANCED > Advanced > Router / AP Mode. The Router / AP Mode page displays. 6. Select the AP Mode radio button. The page adjusts. 7. Select the IP address setting: Get dynamically from existing router. The other router on the network assigns an IP address to the Orbi router while the Orbi router is in AP mode. Enable fixed IP settings on this device (not recommended). Use this setting if you want to manually assign a specific IP address to the Orbi router while it is in AP mode. Using this option effectively requires advanced network experience. Note: To avoid interference with other routers or gateways in your network, we recommend that you use different WiFi settings on each router and gateway. If the other router or gateway is also a WiFi access point, you could turn off the WiFi radio on the other router or gateway and use the Orbi router only for WiFi client access.

5. Select the Turn UPnP On check box. By default, this check box is selected. UPnP for automatic device configuration can be enabled or disabled. If the Turn UPnP On check box is cleared, the router does not allow any device to automatically control router resources, such as port forwarding. 6. Type the advertisement period in minutes. The advertisement period specifies how often the router broadcasts its UPnP information. This value can range from 1 to 1440 minutes. The default period is 30 minutes. Shorter durations ensure that control points receive current device status at the expense of more network traffic. Longer durations can compromise the freshness of the device status but can significantly reduce network traffic. 7. Type the advertisement time to live in hops. The time to live for the advertisement is measured in hops (steps) for each UPnP packet sent. Hops are the steps a packet takes between routers. The number of hops can range from 1 to 255. The default value for the advertisement time to live is 4 hops, which should be fine for most home networks. If you notice that some devices are not being updated or reached correctly, it might be necessary to increase this value. 8. Click the Apply button. The UPnP Portmap Table displays the IP address of each UPnP device that is accessing the router and which ports (internal and external) that device opened. The UPnP Portmap Table also displays what type of port is open and whether that port is still active for each IP address. 9. To refresh the information in the UPnP Portmap Table, click the Refresh button. Set up a bridge for a port group or VLAN tag group Some devices, such as an IPTV, cannot function behind the routers Network Address Translation (NAT) service or firewall.

### Content
About VPN connections A virtual private network (VPN) lets you use the Internet to securely access your network when you arent home. This type of VPN access is called a client-to-gateway tunnel. The computer is the client, and the router is the gateway. To use the VPN feature, you must do the following: Log in to the router to enable and configure OpenVPN (see Enable OpenVPN service in the router on page 114). Install OpenVPN client software and configuration files on your device from which you want to use VPN (see Install OpenVPN software on a VPN client on page 115). Run the OpenVPN client software on your device when you want to use a VPN connection. Enabling OpenVPN on your router allows VPN connections between the router and a client, for example your laptop when you are away from home. The router provides the VPN service and the laptop is the VPN client. Traffic between the router and the laptop is encrypted. Note: The router itself does not function as a VPN client to an external VPN service provider, so it does not encrypt traffic passing between your home network and the Internet. VPN can use either Dynamic DNS (DDNS) or a static IP address to connect with your router: To use a DDNS service, register for a DDNS account with a host name. You use the host name to access your network. The router supports these DDNS accounts: NETGEAR, No-IP, and Dyn. For more information, see Manage Dynamic DNS on page 72. If your Internet service provider (ISP) assigned a static WAN IP address that never changes, the VPN can use that IP address to connect to your home network. LAN IP addressing in VPN networks For the VPN connection to work, your computer or device (the VPN client) must be connected to a network that uses a different LAN IP address scheme than your router. The default LAN IP address scheme for the router is 192.168.1.x. (The most common IP schemes are 192.168.x.x, 172.x.x.x, and 10.x.x.x.) If you experience a conflict, change the IP scheme either for your home network or for the network where your VPN client device is connected.

If both networks use the same LAN IP scheme, when the VPN tunnel is established, you cannot access your home router or your home network with the OpenVPN software. For information about changing the LAN settings on the router, see Change the LAN TCP/IP settings on page 76. Enable OpenVPN service in the router You must enable the OpenVPN service settings in the router before you can use a VPN connection. To enable OpenVPN service: 1. Launch a web browser from a computer or mobile device that is connected to your Orbi network. 2. Enter orbilogin.com. A login window opens. 3. Enter the admin user name and password. The user name is admin. The password is the one that you specified the first time that you logged in. The user name and password are case-sensitive. The BASIC Home page displays. 4. Select ADVANCED > Advanced > VPN Service. The VPN Service page displays. Note: The OpenVPN configuration software packages that you can download on the page are for the VPN client devices (see Install OpenVPN software on a VPN client on page 115). 5. Select the Enable VPN Service check box. We recommend that you use the default TUN mode and TAP mode settings. (These settings determine how VPN information is transferred.) If you know that you need other settings, you can change the TUN mode and TAP mode settings, but you must do so before you download and install the OpenVPN configuration software packages on client devices (see Install OpenVPN software on a VPN client on page 115). 6. To change the TUN mode settings, do the following: To change the TUN mode service type, select the UDP or TCP radio button. The default protocol for TUN mode is UDP. To change the TUN mode service port, type the port number that you want to use in the field. User Manual 114 Use OpenVPN to Access Your Network Orbi Whole Home Tri-Band Mesh WiFi 6 System

The default port number for TUN mode is 12973. The TUN port number is used in the .ovpn file of the OpenVPN configuration software package for Mac and non-Windows clients. 7. To change the TAP mode settings, do the following: To change the TAP mode service type, select the UDP or TCP radio button. The default protocol for TAP mode is UDP. To change the TAP mode service port, type the port number that you want to use in the field. The default port number for TAP mode is 12974. The TAP port number is used in the .ovpn file of the OpenVPN configuration software package for Windows clients. 8. Click the Apply button. Your changes are saved. VPN is enabled in the router, but you must install and set up OpenVPN software on your device before you can use a VPN connection. Install OpenVPN software on a VPN client You must install OpenVPN software on each Windows-based computer, Mac computer, iOS device, and Android device that you plan to use for VPN connections to your router. Each computer or device is called a VPN client. The software consists of the application software and the configuration files: Download and install the application software from the link that is provided in each client-specific section. Download and install the configuration files from the router as described in each client-specific section. The configuration files provide the correct router configuration information for the client utility. You must download the configuration files after you enable and configure OpenVPN service in the router (see Enable OpenVPN service in the router on page 114). Note: If you later change the OpenVPN configuration in the router (for example, you change the TUN or TAP port number), you must download and install the .ovpn configuration file again on each client, depending on its operating system. If you change the TUN port number in the router, the .ovpn configuration file for Mac and non-Windows clients changes. If you change the TAP port number in the router, the .ovpn configuration file for Windows clients changes.

Use VPN to access your Internet service at home When youre away from home and you access the Internet, you usually use a local Internet service provider. For example, at a coffee shop you might be given a code that lets you use the coffee shops Internet service account to surf the web. Your router lets you use a VPN connection to access your own Internet service when youre away from home. You might want to do this if you travel to a geographic location that doesnt support all the Internet services that you use at home. For example, your Netflix account might work at home but not in a different country. Allow VPN client Internet access in the router By default, the router is set up to allow VPN connections only to your home network, but you can change the settings to allow Internet access. Accessing the Internet remotely through a VPN might be slower than accessing the Internet directly. To allow VPN clients to use your home Internet service: 1. Launch a web browser from a computer or mobile device that is connected to your Orbi network. 2. Enter orbilogin.com. A login window opens. 3. Enter the admin user name and password.

Manage port forwarding to a local server If your home network includes a server, you can allow certain types of incoming traffic to reach the server. For example, you might want to make a local web server, FTP server, or game server visible and available to the Internet. The router can forward incoming traffic with specific protocols to computers on your local network. You can specify the servers for applications and you can also specify a default DMZ server to which the router forwards all other incoming protocols. Set up port forwarding to a local server To forward specific incoming protocols to a local server: 1. Decide which type of service, application, or game you want to provide. 2. Find the local IP address of the computer on your network that will provide the service. The server computer must always use the same IP address. To specify this setting, use the reserved IP address feature. See Manage reserved LAN IP addresses on page 80. 3. Launch a web browser from a computer or mobile device that is connected to your Orbi network. 4. Enter orbilogin.com. A login window opens. 5. Enter the admin user name and password. The user name is admin. The password is the one that you specified the first time that you logged in. The user name and password are case-sensitive. The BASIC Home page displays. 6.

The port forwarding entry is removed from the table. How the router implements the port forwarding rule The following sequence shows the effects of a port forwarding rule: 1. When you type the URL www.example.com in your browser, the browser sends a web page request message with the following destination information: Destination address. The IP address of www.example.com, which is the address of your router. Destination port number. 80, which is the standard port number for a web server process. 2. Your router receives the message and finds your port forwarding rule for incoming port 80 traffic. 3. The router changes the destination in the message to IP address 192.168.1.123 and sends the message to that computer. 4. Your web server at IP address 192.168.1.123 receives the request and sends a reply message to your router. User Manual 127 Customize Internet Traffic Rules for Ports Orbi Whole Home Tri-Band Mesh WiFi 6 System

5. Your router performs Network Address Translation (NAT) on the source IP address, and sends the reply through the Internet to the computer or WiFi device that sent the web page request. Application example: Make a local web server public If you host a web server on your local network, you can use port forwarding to allow web requests from anyone on the Internet to reach your web server. To make a local web server public: 1. Assign your web server either a fixed IP address or a dynamic IP address using DHCP address reservation. In this example, your router always gives your web server an IP address of 192.168.1.33. 2. On the Port Forwarding/Port Triggering page, configure the router to forward the HTTP service to the local address of your web server at 192.168.1.33. HTTP (port 80) is the standard protocol for web servers. 3. (Optional) Register a host name with a Dynamic DNS service, and specify that name on the Dynamic DNS page of the router. Dynamic DNS makes it much easier to access a server from the Internet because you can type the name in the Internet browser. Otherwise, you must know the IP address that the ISP assigned, which typically changes. Manage port triggering Port triggering is a dynamic extension of port forwarding that is useful in these cases: An application must use port forwarding to more than one local computer (but not simultaneously). An application must open incoming ports that are different from the outgoing port. With port triggering, the router monitors traffic to the Internet from an outbound trigger port that you specify. For outbound traffic from that port, the router saves the IP address of the computer that sent the traffic. The router temporarily opens the incoming port or ports that you specify in your rule and forwards that incoming traffic to that destination. Port forwarding creates a static mapping of a port number or range of ports to a single local computer. Port triggering can dynamically open ports to any computer when needed and close the ports when they are no longer needed.

To change the time-out period, in the Port Triggering Timeout field, enter a value up to 9999 minutes. This value controls how long the inbound ports stay open when the router detects no activity. This value is required because the router cannot detect when the application terminates. Application example: Port triggering for Internet Relay Chat Some application servers, such as FTP and IRC servers, send replies to multiple port numbers. Using port triggering, you can tell the router to open more incoming ports when a particular outgoing port starts a session.

An example is Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Your computer connects to an IRC server at destination port 6667. The IRC server not only responds to your originating source port, but also sends an identify message to your computer on port 113. Using port triggering, you can tell the router, When you initiate a session with destination port 6667, you must also allow incoming traffic on port 113 to reach the originating computer. The following sequence shows the effects of the port triggering rule you define: 1. You open an IRC client program to start a chat session on your computer. 2. Your IRC client composes a request message to an IRC server using a destination port number of 6667, the standard port number for an IRC server process. Your computer then sends this request message to your router. 3. Your router creates an entry in its internal session table describing this communication session between your computer and the IRC server. Your router stores the original information, performs Network Address Translation (NAT) on the source address and port, and sends this request message through the Internet to the IRC server. 4. Noting your port triggering rule and observing the destination port number of 6667, your router creates another session entry to send any incoming port 113 traffic to your computer. 5. The IRC server sends a return message to your router using the NAT-assigned source port (for example, port 33333) as the destination port. The IRC server also sends an identify message to your router with destination port 113. 6. When your router receives the incoming message to destination port 33333, it checks its session table to see if a session is active for port number 33333. Finding an active session, the router restores the original address information replaced by NAT and sends this reply message to your computer. 7. When your router receives the incoming message to destination port 113, it checks its session table and finds an active session for port 113 associated with your computer. The router replaces the messages destination IP address with your computers IP address and forwards the message to your computer. 8. When you finish your chat session, your router eventually senses a period of inactivity in the communications. The router then removes the session information from its session table, and incoming traffic is no longer accepted on port numbers 33333 or 113.

Quick tips This section describes tips for troubleshooting some common problems. Sequence to restart your network When you restart your network, follow this sequence: 1. Turn off and unplug the modem. 2. Turn off the router. 3. Plug in the modem and turn it on. Wait two minutes. 4. Turn on the router and wait two minutes. WiFi settings Make sure that the WiFi settings in the WiFi-enabled computer or mobile device and the router match. The WiFi network name (SSID) and WiFi security settings must match exactly. If you set up an access list, you must add each WiFi-enabled computer or mobile devices MAC address to the routers access list. Network settings Make sure that the network settings of the computer are correct. Wired and wirelessly connected computers must use network (IP) addresses on the same network as the router. The simplest way to do this is to configure each computer to obtain an IP address automatically using DHCP. Some cable modem service providers require you to use the MAC address of the computer initially registered on the account. You can view the MAC address on the Attached Devices page. The router and satellite do not sync If you are experiencing difficulty syncing the router and the satellite, we recommend that you move the satellite into the same room as the router during the sync. Then move the satellite to a different location. User Manual 133 Troubleshooting Orbi Whole Home Tri-Band Mesh WiFi 6 System

To sync the router and the satellite: 1. Place the satellite in the same room as the Orbi router. Use this satellite location only during the sync process. 2. Connect the satellite to a power source. 3. Wait for the satellite LED to light solid white or magenta. 4. Press the Sync button on the router and then within two minutes, press the Sync button on the satellite. 5. Wait for the satellite to light. The satellite LED pulses white while it attempts to sync with the router. After the LED pulses white, it lights one of the following colors: Blue. The Orbi router and satellite successfully synced, and the connection between the router and satellite is good. Amber. The Orbi router and satellite failed to sync. Try repeating Step 4 again. If the sync keeps failing, try moving the satellite to a different location that's closer to the router. 6. Move the satellite to a new location and connect the satellite to a power source. 7. At the new location, check the satellite LED and make sure it lights blue. If the satellite LED lights blue, the satellite synced successfully. If the satellite LED lights amber, move the satellite closer to the router and try again. The satellite must be within range of the router's WiFi cover area for a good connection to the router. You cannot log in to the router Make sure that your computer or mobile device is connected to the Orbi WiFi network. If you do not want to use a WiFi connection, you can connect your computer to the Orbi router with an Ethernet cable. If you changed the admin password and you forgot what it is, see Reset the admin password on page 97. User Manual 134 Troubleshooting Orbi Whole Home Tri-Band Mesh WiFi 6 System

You cannot access the Internet Check your network and Internet connections: 1. Make sure that your WiFi-enabled computer or mobile device is connected to the Orbi network. 2. If you are connected to Orbi but you cannot access the Internet, check to see if your Internet connection is working. 3. Launch a web browser from a computer or WiFi device that is connected to the network. 4. Enter orbilogin.com. A login window opens. 5. Enter the router admin user name and password. The user name is admin. The default password is password. The user name and password are case-sensitive. The BASIC Home page displays. 6. Click the ADVANCED tab. The ADVANCED Home page displays. 7. Check that an IP address is shown for the Internet port. If 0.0.0.0 is shown, your router did not obtain an IP address from your Internet service provider (ISP). If your router cannot obtain an IP address from the ISP, you can force your cable or DSL modem to recognize your new router by restarting your network. For more information, see Sequence to restart your network on page 133. If your router is still unable to obtain an IP address from the ISP, the problem might be one of the following: Your Internet service provider (ISP) might require a login program. Ask your ISP whether they require PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) or some other type of login. If your ISP requires a login, the login name and password might be set incorrectly.

Your ISP might check for your computers host name. Assign the computer host name of your ISP account as the account name on the Internet Setup page. If your ISP allows only one Ethernet MAC address to connect to Internet and checks for your computers MAC address, do one of the following: - Inform your ISP that you bought a new network device and ask them to use the routers MAC address. - Configure your router to clone your computers MAC address. Troubleshoot Internet browsing If your router can obtain an IP address but your computer is unable to load any web pages from the Internet, it might be for one of the following reasons: The traffic meter is enabled, and the limit was reached. By configuring the traffic meter not to block Internet access when the traffic limit is reached, you can resume Internet access. If your ISP sets a usage limit, they might charge you for the overage. Your computer might not recognize any DNS server addresses. A DNS server is a host on the Internet that translates Internet names (such as www addresses) to numeric IP addresses. Typically, your ISP provides the addresses of one or two DNS servers for your use. If you entered a DNS address during the routers configuration, restart your computer. Alternatively, you can configure your computer manually with a DNS address, as explained in the documentation for your computer. The router might not be configured as the default gateway on your computer. Reboot the computer and verify that the router address (www.orbilogin.com) is listed by your computer as the default gateway address. You might be running login software that is no longer needed. If your ISP provided a program to log you in to the Internet, you no longer need to run that software after installing your router. You might need to go to Internet Explorer and select Tools > Internet Options, click the Connections tab, and select Never dial a connection. Other browsers provide similar options.

Troubleshoot PPPoE If you are using PPPoE, try troubleshooting your Internet connection. To troubleshoot a PPPoE connection: 1. Launch a web browser from a computer or WiFi device that is connected to the network. 2. Enter orbilogin.com. A login window opens. 3. Enter the router admin user name and password. The user name is admin. The default password is password. The user name and password are case-sensitive. The BASIC Home page displays. 4. Click the ADVANCED tab. The ADVANCED Home page displays. 5. In the Internet Port pane, click the Connection Status button. The Connection Status window opens. 6. Check the Connection Status window to see if your PPPoE connection is active and working. If the router is not connected, click the Connect button. The router continues to attempt to connect indefinitely. 7. If you cannot connect after several minutes, the router might be set up with an incorrect service name, user name, or password, or your ISP might be experiencing a provisioning problem. Unless you connect manually, the router does not authenticate using PPPoE until data is transmitted to the network. Troubleshoot WiFi connectivity If you are experiencing trouble connecting to the Orbi WiFi network, try to isolate the problem: Can your WiFi-enabled computer or mobile device that you are using find your WiFi network?

Does your WiFi-capable device support the security that you are using for your WiFi network (WPA3, WPA2, or WPA)? To view the WiFi settings for the router, use an Ethernet cable to connect a computer to an Ethernet port on the router. Then log in to the router, and select BASIC > Wireless. Note: Be sure to click the Apply button if you change settings. If you are trying to connect to the 5 GHz WiFi band, does your WiFi-enabled computer or mobile device support this standard? Did your computer or WiFi device automatically connect to a different WiFi network in your area, such as a WiFi hotspot? Troubleshoot your network using the ping utility Most network devices and routers contain a ping utility that sends an echo request packet to the designated device. The device then responds with an echo reply. You can easily troubleshoot a network using the ping utility in your computer or workstation. Test the LAN path to your router You can ping the router from your computer to verify that the LAN path to your router is set up correctly. To ping the router from a Windows computer: 1. From the Windows toolbar, click the Start button and select Run. 2. In the field provided, type ping followed by the IP address of the router, as in this example: ping www.orbilogin.com 3. Click the OK button. You should see a message like this one: Pinging <IP address > with 32 bytes of data If the path is working, you see this message: Reply from < IP address >: bytes=32 time=NN ms TTL=xxx If the path is not working, you see this message: User Manual 138 Troubleshooting Orbi Whole Home Tri-Band Mesh WiFi 6 System

Request timed out If the path is not functioning correctly, you might be experiencing one of the following problems: Wrong physical connections Check that the appropriate LEDs are on for your network devices. If your router and computer are connected to a separate Ethernet switch, make sure that the link LEDs on the switch are lit for the switch ports that your computer and router are connected to. Wrong network configuration Verify that the Ethernet card driver software and TCP/IP software are both installed and configured on your computer. Verify that the IP address for your router and your computer are correct and that the addresses are on the same subnet. Test the path from your computer to a remote device After verifying that the LAN path works correctly, test the path from your computer to a remote device. To test the path from your computer to a remote device: 1. From the Windows toolbar, click the Start button and select Run. 2. In the Windows Run window, type: ping -n 10 <IP address> where <IP address> is the IP address of a remote device such as your ISP DNS server. If the path is functioning correctly, messages display that are similar to those shown in Test the LAN path to your router on page 138. If you do not receive replies, check the following: Check to see that the IP address of your router is listed as the default gateway for your computer. If DHCP assigns the IP configuration of your computers, this information is not visible in your computer Network Control Panel. Verify that the IP address of the router is listed as the default gateway. Check to see that the network address of your computer (the portion of the IP address specified by the subnet mask) is different from the network address of the remote device. Check to see that your cable or DSL modem is connected and functioning. User Manual 139 Troubleshooting Orbi Whole Home Tri-Band Mesh WiFi 6 System

If your ISP assigned a host name to your computer, enter that host name as the account name on the Internet Setup page. Your ISP might be rejecting the Ethernet MAC addresses of all but one of your computers. Many broadband ISPs restrict access by allowing traffic only from the MAC address of your broadband modem. Some ISPs additionally restrict access to the MAC address of a single computer connected to that modem. If your ISP does this, configure your router to clone or spoof the MAC address from the authorized computer. User Manual 140 Troubleshooting Orbi Whole Home Tri-Band Mesh WiFi 6 System
